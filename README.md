For my Statistical Methods in Epidemiology class, we were asked to analyze longitudinal data and investigate the relationship between systolic blood pressure and mortality.
Using SAS, I prepared the dataset and developed a Cox regression model to assess associations, identify confounders, and evaluate effect modifiers. 
I then compiled my methods and findings into a two-page report.
